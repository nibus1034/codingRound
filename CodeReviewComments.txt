Code Review Comments

 1. TestNG annotations can be used for better execution experience.
 2. Creating Webelements can help in easily referencing the elements in the code.
 3. Each class is having different way of implementation.It would be better if all classes are in the same format as it will ease in code maintainence & reusability.
 4.Page Object Model can be implemented, which makes code cleaner and easy to understand.
 5. Method names can be made  realistic.

Implementation 

 1. TestNG annotations have been implemented. Before and After Test annotation has been used to  setup the application & close application during the script execution.
 2. Page Object Model has been implemented for each page so as to separate object repository from test code. 
 3. Reusable library has been implemented to keep the frequently reusable code. 
 4. Method names have been refactored to be more realistic. 

I have used 2 git accounts nibus1034 & subz1034 for checking in the code.
